# Prompt Engineering

**Personal notes from Deep learning.ai [chatgpt's promt engineering course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)**

Using `LLM`(Large language models) such as ChatGPT to write effective prompts. 
## Principles
1. Write clear and specific instructions
2. Give the model time to "think"

### Loading API key and relevant python libraries

``` python 
import openai
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv,find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

openapi.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

### Helper function 
``` python 
def get_completion(prompt,model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
  messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

## Tactics

### Principle 1: writing clear instructions

**Tactic 1:** Use delimiter to clearly indicate parts of the input
- Delimiters can be anything like: ```,`"""`,`<>`,` <tag></tag>`, `:`

Sample:

``` python
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Output:
``` 
To guide a model towards the desired output and reduce the chances of irrelevant or incorrect responses, it is important to provide clear and specific instructions, which may require longer prompts for more clarity and context.
```

**Tactic 2:** Ask for structured output
 - JSON,HTML

Sample:
``` python
prompt = f"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \ 
with their authors and genres. 
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
book_id, title, author, genre.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Output:
``` json
[
  {
    "book_id": 1,
    "title": "The Lost City of Zorath",
    "author": "Aria Blackwood",
    "genre": "Fantasy"
  },
  {
    "book_id": 2,
    "title": "The Last Survivors",
    "author": "Ethan Stone",
    "genre": "Science Fiction"
  },
  {
    "book_id": 3,
    "title": "The Secret of the Haunted Mansion",
    "author": "Lila Rose",
    "genre": "Mystery"
  }
]
```


**Tactic 3:** Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied

Sample:
``` python
text_1 = f"""
Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some \ 
water boiling. While that's happening, \ 
grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is \ 
hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. \ 
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a \ 
few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you \ 
like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. \ 
And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious \ 
cup of tea to enjoy.
"""
prompt = f"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
If it contains a sequence of instructions, \ 
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \ 
then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_1}\"\"\"
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 1:")
print(response)
```

Output:
``` 
Completion for Text 1:
Step 1 - Get some water boiling.
Step 2 - Grab a cup and put a tea bag in it.
Step 3 - Once the water is hot enough, pour it over the tea bag.
Step 4 - Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep.
Step 5 - After a few minutes, take out the tea bag.
Step 6 - Add some sugar or milk to taste.
Step 7 - Enjoy your delicious cup of tea!
```

**Tactic 4:** "Few-shot" prompting
Sample:

``` python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \ 
valley flows from a modest spring; the \ 
grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Output:
```
<grandparent>: Resilience is like a tree that bends with the wind but never breaks. It is the ability to bounce back from adversity and keep moving forward, even when things get tough. Just like a tree that grows stronger with each storm it weathers, resilience is a quality that can be developed and strengthened over time.
```


### principle 2: Give the model time to "Think"

**Tactic 1:** Specify the steps required to complete the task

Sample: 

``` python
text = f"""
In a charming village, siblings Jack and Jill set out on \ 
a quest to fetch water from a hilltop \ 
well. As they climbed, singing joyfully, misfortune \ 
struck—Jack tripped on a stone and tumbled \ 
down the hill, with Jill following suit. \ 
Though slightly battered, the pair returned home to \ 
comforting embraces. Despite the mishap, \ 
their adventurous spirits remained undimmed, and they \ 
continued exploring with delight.
"""
# example 1
prompt_1 = f"""
Perform the following actions: 
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by triple \
backticks with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a json object that contains the following \
keys: french_summary, num_names.

Separate your answers with line breaks.

Text:
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt_1)
print("Completion for prompt 1:")
print(response)

```

Output:
```
Completion for prompt 1:
Two siblings, Jack and Jill, go on a quest to fetch water from a well on a hilltop, but misfortune strikes and they both tumble down the hill, returning home slightly battered but with their adventurous spirits undimmed.

Deux frères et sœurs, Jack et Jill, partent en quête d'eau d'un puits sur une colline, mais un malheur frappe et ils tombent tous les deux de la colline, rentrant chez eux légèrement meurtris mais avec leurs esprits aventureux intacts. 
Noms: Jack, Jill. 

{
  "french_summary": "Deux frères et sœurs, Jack et Jill, partent en quête d'eau d'un puits sur une colline, mais un malheur frappe et ils tombent tous les deux de la colline, rentrant chez eux légèrement meurtris mais avec leurs esprits aventureux intacts.",
  "num_names": 2
}
```

Ask for output in specified format
Sample:

``` python
prompt_2 = f"""
Your task is to perform the following actions: 
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by 
  <> with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a json object that contains the 
  following keys: french_summary, num_names.

Use the following format:
Text: <text to summarize>
Summary: <summary>
Translation: <summary translation>
Names: <list of names in Italian summary>
Output JSON: <json with summary and num_names>

Text: <{text}>
"""
response = get_completion(prompt_2)
print("\nCompletion for prompt 2:")
print(response)
```

Output:
```
Completion for prompt 2:
Summary: Jack and Jill go on a quest to fetch water, but misfortune strikes and they tumble down the hill, returning home slightly battered but with their adventurous spirits undimmed. 
Translation: Jack et Jill partent en quête d'eau, mais la malchance frappe et ils dégringolent la colline, rentrant chez eux légèrement meurtris mais avec leurs esprits aventureux intacts.
Names: Jack, Jill
Output JSON: {"french_summary": "Jack et Jill partent en quête d'eau, mais la malchance frappe et ils dégringolent la colline, rentrant chez eux légèrement meurtris mais avec leurs esprits aventureux intacts.", "num_names": 2}
```

**Tactic 2:** Intruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
Sample:
```` python

prompt = f"""
Your task is to determine if the student's solution \
is correct or not.
To solve the problem do the following:
- First, work out your own solution to the problem. 
- Then compare your solution to the student's solution \ 
and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. 
Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until 
you have done the problem yourself.

Use the following format:
Question:
```
question here
```
Student's solution:
```
student's solution here
```
Actual solution:
```
steps to work out the solution and your solution here
```
Is the student's solution the same as actual solution \
just calculated:
```
yes or no
```
Student grade:
```
correct or incorrect
```

Question:
```
I'm building a solar power installation and I need help \
working out the financials. 
- Land costs $100 / square foot
- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost \
me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square \
foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations \
as a function of the number of square feet.
``` 
Student's solution:
```
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000
```
Actual solution:
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
 ````

Output:
````
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 10x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 10x = 360x + 100,000

Is the student's solution the same as actual solution just calculated:
```
No
```
Student grade:
```
incorrect

# Hallucination
models will try to make up obscure information based on your prompts. even if the prompt is incorrect
## Tactics to reduce hallucination

- first find relevant information
- then answer the question based on relevant information
