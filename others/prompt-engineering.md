# Prompt Engineering

**Personal notes from Deep learning.ai [chatgpt's promt engineering course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)**

Using `LLM`(Large language models) such as ChatGPT to write effective prompts. 
## Principles
1. Write clear and specific instructions
2. Give the model time to "think"

### Loading API key and relevant python libraries

``` python 
import openai
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv,find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

openapi.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

### Helper function 
``` python 
def get_completion(prompt,model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
  messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

## Tactics

### Principle 1: writing clear instructions

**Tactic 1:** Use delimiter to clearly indicate parts of the input
- Delimiters can be anything like: ```,`"""`,`<>`,` <tag></tag>`, `:`

Sample:

``` python
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Output:
``` 
To guide a model towards the desired output and reduce the chances of irrelevant or incorrect responses, it is important to provide clear and specific instructions, which may require longer prompts for more clarity and context.
```

**Tactic 2:** Ask for structured output
 - JSON,HTML

Sample:
``` python
prompt = f"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \ 
with their authors and genres. 
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
book_id, title, author, genre.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Output:
``` json
[
  {
    "book_id": 1,
    "title": "The Lost City of Zorath",
    "author": "Aria Blackwood",
    "genre": "Fantasy"
  },
  {
    "book_id": 2,
    "title": "The Last Survivors",
    "author": "Ethan Stone",
    "genre": "Science Fiction"
  },
  {
    "book_id": 3,
    "title": "The Secret of the Haunted Mansion",
    "author": "Lila Rose",
    "genre": "Mystery"
  }
]
```


**Tactic 3:** Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied

Sample:
``` python
text_1 = f"""
Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some \ 
water boiling. While that's happening, \ 
grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is \ 
hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. \ 
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a \ 
few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you \ 
like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. \ 
And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious \ 
cup of tea to enjoy.
"""
prompt = f"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
If it contains a sequence of instructions, \ 
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \ 
then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_1}\"\"\"
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 1:")
print(response)
```

Output:
``` 
Completion for Text 1:
Step 1 - Get some water boiling.
Step 2 - Grab a cup and put a tea bag in it.
Step 3 - Once the water is hot enough, pour it over the tea bag.
Step 4 - Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep.
Step 5 - After a few minutes, take out the tea bag.
Step 6 - Add some sugar or milk to taste.
Step 7 - Enjoy your delicious cup of tea!
```

** Tactic 4: ** "Few-shot" prompting
Sample:

``` python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \ 
valley flows from a modest spring; the \ 
grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Output:
```
<grandparent>: Resilience is like a tree that bends with the wind but never breaks. It is the ability to bounce back from adversity and keep moving forward, even when things get tough. Just like a tree that grows stronger with each storm it weathers, resilience is a quality that can be developed and strengthened over time.
```
