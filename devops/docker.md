# Docker
## Docker definition
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

## advantages
- **Lightweight** - Containers running on a single machine all share that machine's operating system kernel; they start instantly and use less RAM.
- **Standard** - Containers are on standard and predictable environment that can be easily reproduced.
- **Secure** - Containers apply aggressive constraints and isolations to processes without any configuration required on the part of the user.
- **Portable** - Containers can be created and tested on a laptop and deployed on a cloud server.
- **Easy Configuration** - Containers can be created and deployed from a simple set of instructions (known as a Dockerfile) and a single container image.
- **Easy to Share** - Docker Hub makes it easy to share containers and automate workflows.
