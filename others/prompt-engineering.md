# Prompt Engineering

**Personal notes from Deep learning.ai [chatgpt's promt engineering course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)**

Using `LLM`(Large language models) such as ChatGPT to write effective prompts. 
## Principles
1. Write clear and specific instructions
2. Give the model time to "think"

### Loading API key and relevant python libraries

``` python 
import openai
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv,find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

openapi.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

### Helper function 
``` python 
def get_completion(prompt,model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
  messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

## Tactics

### Principle 1: writing clear instructions

**Tactic 1:** Use delimiter to clearly indicate parts of the input
- Delimiters can be anything like: ```,`"""`,`<>`,` <tag></tag>`, `:`

Sample:

``` python
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Output:
``` 
To guide a model towards the desired output and reduce the chances of irrelevant or incorrect responses, it is important to provide clear and specific instructions, which may require longer prompts for more clarity and context.
```

**Tactic 2:** Ask for structured output
 - JSON,HTML

Sample:
``` python
prompt = f"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \ 
with their authors and genres. 
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
book_id, title, author, genre.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Output:
``` json
[
  {
    "book_id": 1,
    "title": "The Lost City of Zorath",
    "author": "Aria Blackwood",
    "genre": "Fantasy"
  },
  {
    "book_id": 2,
    "title": "The Last Survivors",
    "author": "Ethan Stone",
    "genre": "Science Fiction"
  },
  {
    "book_id": 3,
    "title": "The Secret of the Haunted Mansion",
    "author": "Lila Rose",
    "genre": "Mystery"
  }
]
```


**Tactic 3:** Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied

Sample:
``` python
text_1 = f"""
Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some \ 
water boiling. While that's happening, \ 
grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is \ 
hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. \ 
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a \ 
few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you \ 
like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. \ 
And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious \ 
cup of tea to enjoy.
"""
prompt = f"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
If it contains a sequence of instructions, \ 
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \ 
then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_1}\"\"\"
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 1:")
print(response)
```

Output:
``` 
Completion for Text 1:
Step 1 - Get some water boiling.
Step 2 - Grab a cup and put a tea bag in it.
Step 3 - Once the water is hot enough, pour it over the tea bag.
Step 4 - Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep.
Step 5 - After a few minutes, take out the tea bag.
Step 6 - Add some sugar or milk to taste.
Step 7 - Enjoy your delicious cup of tea!
```

**Tactic 4:** "Few-shot" prompting
Sample:

``` python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \ 
valley flows from a modest spring; the \ 
grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Output:
```
<grandparent>: Resilience is like a tree that bends with the wind but never breaks. It is the ability to bounce back from adversity and keep moving forward, even when things get tough. Just like a tree that grows stronger with each storm it weathers, resilience is a quality that can be developed and strengthened over time.
```


### principle 2: Give the model time to "Think"

**Tactic 1:** Specify the steps required to complete the task

Sample: 

``` python
text = f"""
In a charming village, siblings Jack and Jill set out on \ 
a quest to fetch water from a hilltop \ 
well. As they climbed, singing joyfully, misfortune \ 
struck—Jack tripped on a stone and tumbled \ 
down the hill, with Jill following suit. \ 
Though slightly battered, the pair returned home to \ 
comforting embraces. Despite the mishap, \ 
their adventurous spirits remained undimmed, and they \ 
continued exploring with delight.
"""
# example 1
prompt_1 = f"""
Perform the following actions: 
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by triple \
backticks with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a json object that contains the following \
keys: french_summary, num_names.

Separate your answers with line breaks.

Text:
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt_1)
print("Completion for prompt 1:")
print(response)

```

Output:
```
Completion for prompt 1:

```

**Tactic 2:** Intruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
Sample:
```` python

prompt = f"""
Your task is to determine if the student's solution \
is correct or not.
To solve the problem do the following:
- First, work out your own solution to the problem. 
- Then compare your solution to the student's solution \ 
and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. 
Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until 
you have done the problem yourself.

Use the following format:
Question:
```

# Summarizing

Needed a nice lamp for my bedroom, and this one \
had additional storage and not too high of a price \
point. Got it fast - arrived in 2 days. The string \

happily sent over a new one. Came within a few days \
as well. It was easy to put together. Then I had a \
missing part, so I contacted their support and they \
very quickly got me the missing piece! Seems to me \
to be a great company that cares about their customers \
and products.

# review for an electric toothbrush
review_3 = """
My dental hygienist recommended an electric toothbrush, \
which is why I got this. The battery life seems to be \
pretty impressive so far. After initial charging and \
leaving the charger plugged in for the first week to \
condition the battery, I've unplugged the charger and \
been using it for twice daily brushing for the last \
3 weeks all on the same charge. But the toothbrush head \
is too small. I’ve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than \
this one. I wish the head was bigger with different \
length bristles to get between teeth better because \
this one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one \
around the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's \
replacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can \
get generic ones that're more reasonably priced. This \
toothbrush makes me feel like I've been to the dentist \
every day. My teeth feel sparkly clean! 
"""

# review for a blender
review_4 = """
So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \

Title: A Soft and Cute Panda Plush Toy for All Ages
Introduction: As a parent, finding the perfect gift for your child's birthday can be a daunting task. However, I stumbled upon a soft and cute panda plush toy that not only made my daughter happy but also brought joy to me as an adult. In this review, I will share my experience with this product and provide an honest assessment of its features.
Product Description: The panda plush toy is made of high-quality materials that make it super soft and cuddly. Its cute design is perfect for children and adults alike, making it a versatile gift option. The toy is small enough to carry around, making it an ideal companion for your child on their adventures.
Pros: The panda plush toy is incredibly soft and cute, making it an excellent gift for children and adults. Its small size makes it easy to carry around, and its design is perfect for snuggling. The toy arrived a day earlier than expected, which was a pleasant surprise.
Cons: One of the ears is a bit lower than the other, which makes the toy asymmetrical. Additionally, the toy is a bit small for its price, and there might be other options that are bigger for the same price.
Conclusion: Overall, the panda plush toy is an excellent gift option for children and adults who love cute and cuddly toys. Despite its small size and asymmetrical design, the toy's softness and cuteness make up for its shortcomings. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a versatile and adorable gift option.

# review for a blender
review = f"""
So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
two days.
